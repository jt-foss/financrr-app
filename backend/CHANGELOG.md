# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

We use an updated version of the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format.
<br>
What we've changed:
- We use a nicer title format (Version x.x.x (DD.MM.YYYY)) that plays well with `cargo-dist`.
- We add `**[BREAKING]**` to breaking changes to make them stand out more.
  <br>

We do this to make it easier to read when using `cargo-dist` to generate the release notes from the changelog.
